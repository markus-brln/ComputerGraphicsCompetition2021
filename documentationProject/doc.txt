DOCUMENTATION OF DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

March 13 2021
- first try sf::Image 400x400, Scene/3_refraction, standard render -> 2.5 fps
- with openMP -> ~7 fps

March 15
- when moving view around, perspective is not taken into account by raytracer,
  needs fixing
- realized that the green background in the scene was actually another sphere

March 17
- made a virtual screen with:
  Point upperLeft{ eye.x - SIZE / 2, eye.y + SIZE / 2, eye.z - SIZE };
  where SIZE is the amount of pixels in x,y -> leads to 45Â° view
- ray reference (pixel) points generated from:
  Point pixel{ upperLeft.x + x * right.x, upperLeft.y + y * down.y, upperLeft.z };
- screen moves with eye in x,y,z, so no distortions anymore
- TODO: rotation of the eye in x,y,z -> transform upperLeft point and the right+down vectors
